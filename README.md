# Description
Hello friend, hello friend, my favorite dialogue in the movie Mr. Robot, I think it was a masterpiece.

Let's skip and get to the point😅

I created this language and be sure that I will write many libraries for it and this project will not be abandoned and this language will one day become one of the famous programming languages ​​in the world and now that I am publishing this language, although it does not have many libraries, I am only 18 years old and I hope that in the next 10 years when I read this GitHub page, I will achieve my goal and my language will find its own fame. To be honest, I am from Iran and I have been spending my time with computers since childhood and then I was attracted to the world of programming, hacking and security and web user interface design and now I have designed my own language and published it for you.

I remember in school when I said I was designing my own language and that one day I would build a language, even if it was small, my computer teachers really made fun of me and laughed at me, thinking that this project would be good for a boy my age. My work has been valuable and I hope it is. Oh, really

Byte Language was not built from scratch, but it is built on the solid foundation of Lua 5.5.

The reason for this choice is simple: instead of writing a virtual machine from scratch, I used a powerful and tested engine to focus on the more important parts of the design, such as syntax, libraries and peripherals.

And an honest note:
Along the way, I also got help from AI tools. Not in the sense of handing over the project to it, but as an intelligent assistant for:

· Fixing weird bugs

· Suggesting better ways

· Writing documentation

· New techniques

In short:
✅ Main engine: Lua 5.5
✅ Syntax and libraries: Made by myself
✅ AI: Just a helper, not a creative project

This project is the result of hours of coding, trial and error and getting feedback, not a simple request. 🚀

‼️ And in the end I want to say please do not copy this project and respect the creator's rights and this project has a license that does not give you the right to copy and if you see a copy you will face legal prosecution. Good luck
